# Why HTML is not a programming language
This Markdown document explains why HTML is a Markup language and not a programming language.
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is called Hypertext **Markup Language**. HTML **is not** called Hypertext **Programming Language**.

HTML is a type of [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). It encapsulates, or "marks up" data within [HTML tags](https://www.javatpoint.com/html-tags#:~:text=HTML%20tags%20are%20like%20keywords,HTML%20tags%20are%20unclosed%20tags), which define the data and describe its purpose on the webpage. The web browser then reads the HTML, which tells it things like which parts are headings, which parts are paragraphs, which parts are links, etc. The HTML describes the data to the browser, and the browser then displays the data accordingly.

[Programming languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) have [functional purposes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). HTML, as a markup language doesn’t really "do" anything in the sense that a programming language does. HTML contains no [programming logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming). It doesn’t have common conditional statements such as [`if`/`else`](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)). It can’t evaluate expressions or do any math. It doesn’t handle events or carry out tasks. You can’t declare [variables](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) and you can’t write functions. It doesn’t modify or manipulate data in any way. HTML can’t take input and produce output. Think of it this way: you can’t compute the sum of 2 + 2 in HTML; that’s not what it’s for. This is because HTML is not a programming language.

Unfortunately, coding only in HTML doesn’t make you a programmer. In fact, HTML really shines when you use it in conjunction with an actual programming language, such as when using a [web framework](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework). That’s when you can start serving up dynamically created web pages and database applications.
